This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs from the [Microsoft PetImages dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765). The dataset contains 25,000 images (12,500 cats and 12,500 dogs), which are used to train a deep learning model capable of binary classification.
